# VGG16-LoRA-Brain-Tumor-Classifier
The project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically the VGG16 architecture, for tumor classification and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to optimize computational efficiency. The dataset used for training and testing includes MRI scans from different tumor types, such as glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor.

# Brain Tumor Classification using VGG16 and LoRA

This repository contains a Python-based deep learning project for classifying brain tumors from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project uses the VGG16 model architecture for feature extraction and classification, along with the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique to optimize training efficiency.

## Overview

Brain tumor classification plays a crucial role in early diagnosis and treatment planning. This repository provides an implementation for classifying four categories of brain tumors: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor, using MRI scans. The model is trained with a modified VGG16 architecture to handle the complexity and variety of MRI images.
