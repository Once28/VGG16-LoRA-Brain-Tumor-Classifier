# VGG16-LoRA-Brain-Tumor-Classifier
The project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically the VGG16 architecture, for tumor classification and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to optimize computational efficiency. The dataset used for training and testing includes MRI scans from different tumor types, such as glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor.
